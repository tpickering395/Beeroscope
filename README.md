### How to run this environment

-Open two command terminals. Navigate one to within the client folder, and the other to within the server folder.

-In the server terminal, type and enter "nodemon". It should then start the server-side and a message saying "Listening on port #: " should be printed.

( Run "npm install -g nodemon" if it's not installed)

-In the client terminal, enter "npm start" to start the React client. It will take some time on the first load, and it will open a tab in your default browser.

-That's it, you can change the client React code and it will automatically update on the browser, but for changes on the server-side, the server will have to be restarted to apply changes if nodemon doesn't do it for you.
